\section{Dark Matter Searches}
\label{secParticleDMsearches}

The two main goals of the dark matter search are to demonstrate that galaxies are made of a new form of matter, which is the aim of direct and indirect detection techniques used by astroparticle physics community,  and to study the properties of this form of matter, such as their mass, lifetime, and coupling, in experiments at high energy particle colliders.
