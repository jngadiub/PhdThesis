\caption{Expected 95\% CL upper limit on graviton production cross section times the branching fraction of $G_{bulk} \rightarrow WW$ assuming 2.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data. The limit is obtained with the Asymptotic CLs technique. The 68\% and 95\% ranges of expectation are
also shown with green and yellow bands. The expected product between the Bulk graviton
production cross section and the branching fraction is shown as a red solid curve for $\tilde{k} = 0.5$.
Top panel: results for muon channel, HP category on the left, LP on the right. Bottom panel: results for electron channel, HP category on the left, LP on the right.
