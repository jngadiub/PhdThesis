\caption{
Final distributions in \mWH for data and expected backgrounds for electron (left) and muon (right) categories.
The 68\% error bars for Poisson event counts are obtained from the Neyman construction~\cite{Garwood}. The hatched region indicates the statistical uncertainty of the fit combined with the systematical uncertainty in the shape. This figure also shows a hypothetical $\PWpr$ signal with mass of 1.5\TeV, normalized to the cross section predicted by the HVT model B with parameter $g_V=3$ as described in Section.

\caption{
  Observed (solid) and expected (dashed) upper limits at 95\% CL on the
  product of the $\PWpr$ production cross section and the branching
  fraction of $\PWpr\to WH$ for electron (left) and muon (right) channels,
  and the combination of the two channels (lower plot). The products of cross sections and branching fractions for $\PWpr$ production in the LH and HVT models are overlaid.
