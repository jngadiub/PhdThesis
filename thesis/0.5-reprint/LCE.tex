\section{Studies of the Light Detection Efficiency}
\label{secLCE}

The light detection with the photomultipliers is position dependent, due to geometrical properties of the detector and light reflection and diffusion on the surfaces. The photon-to-electron conversion efficiency and reflectivity of the PMTs also depend on the incident angle of photons~\cite{PMTreflectance}.
