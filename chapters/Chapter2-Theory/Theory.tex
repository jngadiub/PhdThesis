\chapter{The standard model and beyond}
\label{ch:theory}

Elementary particles and their interactions are described by a fundamental theory called the standard model (SM)~\cite{QFTbook}.
It describes three of the four fundamental forces of nature, namely the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, in the form of quantum field theories (QFT) with local gauge invariance.
This theory has been confirmed by a large number of experimental results in the last forty years: from the precision measurements performed at the Large Electron Positron (LEP) and Tevatron~\cite{ALEPH:2010aa}
to the recent Large Hadron Collider (LHC) era (Chapter~\ref{ch:CMS}).
The SM constitutes one of the most successful achievements in modern physics.
It provides a very elegant theoretical framework, which is able to describe most of the known experimental phenomena in particle physics with high precision.

The basic ingredients of the SM are reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:SMintro}. This is followed by a discussion in Section~\ref{sec:SMLimitations} about a few of the main open issues of the SM, which motivate theories of new physics.
Finally, three of the most popular theories beyond the standard model are introduced in Section~\ref{sec:BSMintro}. These models provide the theoretical framework in which the search for new particles described in this thesis is conducted.
%As the work carried during this thesis is focused on a search for new heavy resonances, the last Section~\ref{sec:BSMintro} introduces some of the most popular theories of physics beyond the standard model (BSM).
