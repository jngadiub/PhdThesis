\chapter{Object and event reconstruction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the pp collisions at the LHC a large number of particles are produced which must be efficiently reconstructed and identified. These particles travel through the CMS detector and they are classified as objects depending on their specific signature in each subdetector. This chapter covers the reconstruction of physics objects that are needed for the identification of signal events in the lepton plus jet event topology described in Chapter~\ref{ch:dibosonIntro}.

The measurement of tracks in the tracker detector for charged particles and the reconstruction of the primary vertices represent key aspects of the reconstruction of the various objects and are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:tracksandvtx}. Details on the methods for reconstructing electrons, muons and jets present in the final states of these analyses are given, respectively, in Sections~\ref{sec:electrons}, \ref{sec:muons}, and \ref{sec:jets}. %In this analysis $\tau$ leptons are reconstructed as electrons (Section~\ref{sec:electrons}) or muons (Section~\ref{sec:muons}) and accounted to the respective channel if they decay leptonically, or as jets (Section~\ref{sec:jets}) if they decay hadronically. However, only the leptonic decay mode contributes to the analysis since at least one muon or electron has to be reconstructed in the event.
%However, the resulting gain in sensitivity is limited by the small branching ratios.
In addition to leptons and jets, the last type of particle present in the final state is the neutrino, whose presence can be inferred from an imbalance of the transverse momentum (Section~\ref{sec:met}).
The identified lepton and the missing transverse energy in the event are associated with the $\PW\to\ell\Pgn$ candidate which is reconstructed through the algorithms described in Section~\ref{sec:leptonicW}.
