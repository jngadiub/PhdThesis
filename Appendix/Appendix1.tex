A scan of the displays of all the events in 8\TeV data with $\mWH >$ 1.6\TeV passing all the selection criteria for the $\ell\Pgn\bbbar$ final state (Table~\ref{tab:cutsummaryWH}),
reported that presence of two events characterized by a rare specific kind of noise.
This noise arises from an anomalous behaviour of the tracking algorithm in the transition region between the barrel (TOB) and endcap (TEC) regions of the silicon tracker,
namely, in the pseudorapidity range 1~$<|\eta|<$~1.5 (Fig.~\ref{fig:TrackerLayout}). As a consequence, many fake (displaced) tracks are associated to the selected H jet candidate.
Figure~\ref{fig:BadEventData} shows the event display of one of the two events
affected by this problem, while Figure~\ref{fig:BadEventMC} shows the same feature in simulation.

In order to reject this type of noise, it is common in CMS analyses to apply a standard filtering algorithm that discards the event if 
there is an anomalous amount of tracks that have been seeded in the TOB-TEC transition region.
The efficiency of this filter on signal events is about 97\% independently on the H jet \pt.

However, further checks performed on the anomalous events showed that after applying the standard filter 
residual noise can still be identified in the problematic $\eta$ region. Therefore, it has been decided for the analysis described in this work to
apply an additional requirement on the $\eta$ of the selected H jet candidate (Section~\ref{subsec:jetsreco}).
In particular, CA8 jets are rejected if their pseudorapidity falls in the problematic region 1~$<|\eta|<$~1.8.
As described in the following, the choice for this fiducial cut is motivated by the disagreement between data and simulation in the rate
at which the noise occur.

The efficiency of the standard filter is studied as a function of the H jet \pt and $\eta$ in a dijet sample with high statistics in both data and simulation.
%The datasets used for these studies are summarized in Table~\ref{data-dijet}. Events are selected if one of the following trigger has fired: 
%HLT\_PFJet320, HLT\_PFHT650, HLT\_PFNoPUHT650. The performance of the filters in simulation has been studied 
%using the QCD MC samples listed in Table~\ref{mc-bkg-dijet}.
The sample is selected requiring at least two jets, with $\pt > 400\GeV$ for the leading jet and $\pt > 80\GeV$ for the sub-leading one.
At least one of the jet has to be b-tagged using the same combined b tagging algorithm as for the main analysis selection, representing thus the H jet candidate.
The jet that fails the b tagging is required to have low pruned mass ($\mJ < 40\GeV$).

Figure~\ref{fig:hbbjeteta} shows the effect of the filter on the jet $\eta$ distribution comparing data, simulated signal and QCD background:
the signal distribution is rather unaffected while data and QCD background distributions show a reduction of events in the problematic $\eta$ region after applying the filter, as expected.

Figure~\ref{fig:eff-pt-filters-eta1} shows the filter efficiency on data and simulated signal and QCD background as a function 
of the H jet candidate \pt for different jet $\eta$ regions.
A little dependence of the filter efficiency with the jet \pt is observed in the regions $0 < |\eta| < 1$ and $1.0 < |\eta| < 1.5$, 
while in the forward region $1.5 < |\eta| < 2.4$ the efficiency decreases with the jet \pt. 
The performance of the filter in the different $\eta$ regions is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:eff-filters-eta_a}.
A large discrepancy between data and simulation is found in the pseudorapidity region $1.0 < |\eta| < 1.8$, 
where the simulation does not sufficiently well describe the full material budget of the tracking detector.
The same studies are also performed removing the b-tagging requirement. The filter efficiency as a function of the leading 
jet $\eta$ for this case is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff-filters-eta_b}, for both data and simulation.
The increase in efficiency compared to what obtained in b-tagging shows that 
the b-tagging requirement enriches the samples with events characterized by this noise up to 30\%, making this analysis systematically prone to it.
